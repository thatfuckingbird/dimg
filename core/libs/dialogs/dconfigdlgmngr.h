 * The DConfigDlgMngr class provides a means of automatically
 * retrieving, saving and resetting basic settings.
 * It also can emit signals when settings have been changed
 * (settings were saved) or modified (the user changes a checkbox
 * from on to off).
 *
 * The object names of the widgets to be managed have to correspond to the names of the
 * configuration entries in the KConfigSkeleton object plus an additional
 * "kcfg_" prefix. For example a widget with the object name "kcfg_MyOption"
 * would be associated to the configuration entry "MyOption".
 *
 * The widget classes of Qt are supported out of the box.
 *
 * Custom widget classes are supported if they have a Q_PROPERTY defined for the
 * property representing the value edited by the widget. By default the property
 * is used for which "USER true" is set. For using another property, see below.
